# Python-College-Training
 
 ## Introduction
 This repository contains some of the works I have completed as part of the Semester 1 in a Postgraduate in Artificial Intelligence and Software Design. I have always had a great interest in this area of software development, and intend to pursue this in my current and future career. I have used Python before this course, but the course content has really lifted my experience and capabilities, and this is only semester 1. 

 ## What is demonstrated in this repository
 The module for python in SM1 has given an overview of the following:
 1. What is python? Basic Python program (hello world of course!)
 2. Use of conditional programming (IF ELIF Else statements)
 3. Repitition control structures (While, For).
 4. Lists, Tuples and Sets
 5. File Input / Output
 6. Functions and Modules
 7. Exceptions and required handling.
 8. Data Structures
 9. Date Time Module
 10. Testing
 11. Numpy / Pandas
 12. Matplot / Seaborn#

 You can see some examples of the logic I have created in this repository for semester one.  

 ## How to test the code in this repo
 You can view the logic which is in the files. Feel free to examine and leave a remark for any advice or enahncements.
