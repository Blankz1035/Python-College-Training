# as cipher text

# You can also use the pass statement which will allow a piece of logic to skip. example if you have a loop, you can have a pass statement 
# in here to skip the logic. this allows you to keep this code in the project without removing.

# Cipher exercise: 
# Julius Caesar is credited with a basic substitution cipher in which he shifted each
# letter of the alphabet along by 3 places. The original message is referred to as the
# plaintext, represented in lowercase characters, and the enciphered message is
# referred to as the ciphertext, represented in uppercase characters.
# So a is enciphered as D, b is enciphered as E, â€¦ The letters at the end of the alphabet (x, y and z)
# wrap-around to be substituted by the first three
